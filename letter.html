		<h1><p><strong>Re: Eileen Dover University application</strong></p></h1>
			<p>Dear Eileen,<br> <br>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's faculty to study as part of your <u>PhD.</u> next year. I will answer your questions one by one in the following sections.</p><br>
			<article>
				<h3>Starting dates</h3>
					<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suite us better if you could start with us at the beginning of the semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>First semester: 9 september 2016</li>
							<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
							<li>Third semester: 2 may 2017</li>
						</ul><br>
		Please let me know if this is okay, and if so which start date you would prefer.
		<br><br>
		You can find more information about <a href="">important university dates</a> on our website.

				<h3>Subjects of study</h3>
				<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the deas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows in order of priority:
					<ol>
						<li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
						<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F) When the audience size exponentially increases (3x10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3x10<sup>4</sup>). </li>
						<li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for writing musical scores.</li>
					</ol><br>
				So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects including, how long you'd expect the research to take, the required staff and other resoures and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
				</p>

				<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
				<p>
				Yes, you are right! As part of my post-docorate work I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definition:<br><br>
				<p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
					<article class="dance">A little known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a big circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".</article>
				<p>Icelandic Brownian shuffle</p>
					<article class="dance">Before the icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibily tiny very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking</article>	
				<p>Artic robot dance</p>
					<article class="dance">An intresting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960's believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Nothern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</article>
